## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nguyenbinhminh85/Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-ML-Streamlit.git
   cd Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-ML-Streamlit
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with the model to predict customer churn. Input customer details and view the prediction along with insights on the factors influencing churn.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a public telecom dataset. It includes various features such as customer demographics, service usage, and billing information. This rich dataset enables effective analysis and modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is crucial for understanding the dataset. Here are some key steps taken in this project:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Visualizations**: Creating plots to identify trends and patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing correlation analysis to understand feature relationships.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering enhances the model's predictive power. Key steps include:

- **Creating New Features**: Deriving features such as total charges, tenure, and monthly charges.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical features into numerical formats.
- **Scaling Features**: Normalizing numerical features for better model performance.

## Model Development

The logistic regression model was chosen for its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. Key steps include:

- **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Training the logistic regression model on the training set.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Deployment

The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with it in real-time. To access the deployed app, you can check the [Releases section](https://github.com/nguyenbinhminh85/Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-ML-Streamlit/releases) for the latest version.
